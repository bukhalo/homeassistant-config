# 🏠 Home Assistant Configuration
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bukhalo/homeassistant-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bukhalo/homeassistant-config)

Here's my smart home configuration. I have installed HA on ugly old PC. I am currently running Xpenology on the PC and used the Docker to install HA.

I regularly update my configuration files. If you like anything here, Be sure to 🌟 my repo!
